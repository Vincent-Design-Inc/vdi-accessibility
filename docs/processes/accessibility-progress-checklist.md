## What is the progress checklist?

The progress checklist is the second tab in the "Accessibility Sheets" file for your project.

It is attempting to be a simple way to track progress through reviewing WCAG criterion throughout the lifetime of a web project. This way we can tell if certain stages were missed and what needs to be backtracked, and, if there were any issues flagged early on that have not yet been resolved. 

## What is the process like for the progress checklist? 

### Product Owner or Project Manager

1. Create this file near the beginning of the project. 
2. Place it in the project's internal project folder on Google Drive.
3. Prepare the checklist with only items that pertain to the project scope. 
	- Not all criterion will apply to every website project, so, depending on the project scope you will have more or less tasks to worry about. 

### Content, Design, Dev

1. Any member of the relevant team assigned to the project should review their team's relevant criterion. (Content, then design, then dev).
2. If there is no team member assigned to the project for one of the three teams, a QA tester can complete the review(s). 
	- The QA tester can be the Product Owner, or a different team member. 
3. You can filter the tasks by "Task Type" to see only your tasks.

4. Go through the checklist and check off anything you've reviewed in the "Reviewed" column. You may reference the WCAG link, or other resources you like in order to complete the review of the criterion. 
	- The "Main Task Overview" column is Nicky's summary in as simple terms as possible of what VDI's job generally is for each criterion. Don't rely on this column for the full picture of the criterion. 
4. You may use the "Task List" sheet to track any issues you find along the way.

5. Resolve the issues that come up before giving the Product Owner the "all clear" to move onto the next project phase.
