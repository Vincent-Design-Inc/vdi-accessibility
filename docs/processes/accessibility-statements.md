## What is an accessibility statement?

The Admin Bar's article [The What, Why, and How of Accessibility Statements](https://theadminbar.com/accessibility-weekly/the-what-why-and-how-of-accessibility-statements/) explains the background and purpose of accessibility statement's nicely. 

## How can I make one? 

You can make one very easily using the W3C's [Generate an Accessibility Statement page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/generator/#create). It will generate a statement for you based on the information you put into it. Each project's statement will look a bit different depending on the organization's efforts. 

## Does every project need one? 

No. 

### Manitoba 

Organizations in Manitoba with one or more employee must follow the requirements set out by The Accessible Information and Communication Standard under The Accessibility for Manitobans Act. 

This standard outlines a few requirements that may fall nicely onto an Accessibility Statement page [(From AccessibilityMB)][https://accessibilitymb.ca/accessibility/act-standards/the-accessibility-standard-for-information-and-communication.html]:

- **Accessible Information and Formats:** must inform the public and employees that information can be requested through a communication support or accessible format. This may include information related to emergency procedures or public safety.
- **Providing Accessible Information:** when requested, consult with the person to identify the support or format that would remove the barrier and provide the information in a timely manner at no or equal cost.
- **Feedback Process:** develop a process to receive and respond to feedback about accessible information and communication, document responding actions and provide it on request.
- **Documentation:** public sector organizations, educational institutions, libraries, government, private sector organizations and small municipalities with 50+ employees are required to write down all policies, measures and practices and make these documents publicly available.

### Ontario

Organizations in Ontario with one or more employee must follow the requirements set out by the Information and Communications Standards under Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.
