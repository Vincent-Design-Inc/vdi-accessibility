## What is the task list?

You may use the "Task List" sheet to track any issues you find along the way while doing any type of testing.

- **Severity column** is to be used optionally if you want to create sprints where you focus on highest impact items to get a product out the door as quickly as possible. 
- **Task Owner column** should always be filled out in order to create clear assignments and reduce confusion about who is completing what. 
- **Issue Shortname** can be anything you like in order to create clear references. 
- **Related Criterion** is a multiselect where you should pick which WCAG criterion are related to the issue logged. This is extremely helpful for: 
	- Those fixing the issue in order to be able to do research. 
	- Anybody doing QA or auditing in order to check which criterion still have issues to resolve before a site is WCAG compliant.
- **Status** should always be set so it's easy to see at a glance how much work is left to do for the current spring/task log. 
- **Notes** are for anything that helps make the task easier to understand. 
- **Reference** can be for quick links to other tasks, or, external sources the refer to the issue logged.
