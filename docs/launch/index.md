## ❶ Git Deployment

All sites (some exceptions for small placeholder sites) must have Git as their primary source of truth. Once a site is in production, changes need to be made to the repo and then pushed out to the site using a deployment method, usually GitHub Actions (or Deployhq for older sites) but some systems can pull directly from Git (eg. Netlify)

## ❷ Internal Review

You will want to get started on internal reviews well before the launch date, and before the training session with the client. 

### Design Review

Reach out to Brick, or the website's designer, to review how closely the staging site matches the original design. They will review a few other design checkpoints and come back to you with a list of issues. These issues will need to get resolved ideally before the website training session, and definitely before launch. 

### Content Review

Reach out to Holly, Kristin or Katie to review the website content. They will come back with a list of issues based on their review process. These issues will need to get resolved before website launch. 

## ❸ Pre-Launch QA

The site developer must complete a thorough range of QA and testing before a website can launch. We'll want to start on this no less than 1 week before launch.
