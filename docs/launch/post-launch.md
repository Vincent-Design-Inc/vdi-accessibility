## ❶ WordPress Settings

**Site URLs**: MUST be https, not http.  No site should be live on http, everything we do has an SSL certificate automatically.

**Admin Email**: MUST be changed to a client email.  No site should go live with a VDI email as admin unless there's a compelling reason.
  - [Change Admin Email](https://wordpress.org/plugins/change-admin-email-setting-without-outbound-email/) - Change the admin email in WordPress without needing a confirmation email.

## ❷ Analytics

Google Analytics *must* be running on every website we launch.
